# ⚙️ Installation & Setup

## 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syedshaheerhussain/universal-file-analyzer.git
cd PE-ELF_File_Analyzer
````

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pyside6 pefile pyelftools python-docx pdfminer.six beautifulsoup4
```

---

## 3. Run Application

```bash
python main.py
```

---

# ▶️ How to Run

1. Open terminal / command prompt
2. Navigate to project folder
3. Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. GUI will open
5. Click **Open File**
6. Select any file (EXE, PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, ELF)

---

# 🧪 Features

## 🔹 File Support

* `.exe`
* `.dll`
* `.elf`
* `.pdf`
* `.docx`
* `.txt`
* `.html`
* `.xlsx`

---

## 🔹 Analysis Features

* PE Structure Analysis
* ELF Structure Analysis
* Imports & Exports Viewer
* Sections Viewer
* Strings Extraction
* Hex Viewer
* Document Parsing
* Entropy Analysis (Malware Detection)

---

## 🔹 GUI Features

* Modern Dark UI
* Tab-based layout
* Search system
* Export functionality
* Tree-based structure view
* Responsive interface

---

## 🔹 Security / Forensics Features

* File entropy detection
* Packed file detection (high entropy)
* Suspicious binary identification
* Deep file inspection

---

# ⚙️ Functions / How It Works

## 1. File Detection

Automatically detects file type using extension.

## 2. Parsing Engine

Each file type is routed to a dedicated parser:

* PE → pefile
* ELF → pyelftools
* DOCX → python-docx
* PDF → pdfminer
* HTML → BeautifulSoup

---

## 3. Structure Builder

Creates hierarchical tree view:

* Sections
* Imports
* Exports
* Document paragraphs
* Tables

---

## 4. Strings Extraction

Scans binary data and extracts readable text.

---

## 5. Hex Viewer

Displays raw binary in hexadecimal format.

---

## 6. Entropy Analyzer

Calculates randomness of file:

* Low → Normal file
* Medium → Suspicious
* High → Packed / Malware-like

---

## 7. Export System

Exports analysis into JSON format.

---

## 8. Search Engine

Search inside:

* Strings
* Hex
* Info panel

---

# 📊 Working Code Example

```python
from entropy import entropy

data = open("sample.exe", "rb").read()
print(entropy(data))
```

---

# 🧪 Example Use Case

### Malware Analysis

1. Load suspicious `.exe`
2. Check entropy (high = packed)
3. Inspect imports (suspicious API calls)
4. Extract strings (URLs, commands)
5. Analyze structure

---

### Document Forensics

1. Load PDF or DOCX
2. Extract hidden text
3. Analyze metadata
4. Search keywords

---
